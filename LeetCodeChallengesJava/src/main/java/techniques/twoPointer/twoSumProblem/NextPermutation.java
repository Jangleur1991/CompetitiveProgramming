/**
 *
 * The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer.
 * More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical
 * order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container.
 * If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order
 * (i.e., sorted in ascending order).
 *
 * For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
 * Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
 * While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.
 * Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.
 *
 * The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory
